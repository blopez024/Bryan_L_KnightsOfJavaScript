# 🛡️ Knights of JavaScript

## 🎯 Objective

Create a fully functional, browser-based **turn-based battle game** where two players fight until one emerges victorious!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UAz7gK72ZHusX_8Q9_fkruLRz_fkAOSr/view) and extract it.
2. Initialize your Git repository **from inside** the extracted folder.
3. Begin development based on the provided template.

## 🧠 Game Overview

- The game is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- The base logic for Player 1 is provided.
- Your task is to implement Player 2 and ensure full game functionality.

## ✅ Features to Implement

- Replicate Player 1 logic for **Player 2**.
- Track player turns and update button styles using `classList()`.
- Alternate turns by enabling/disabling attack buttons:
  - Active player's button = grey.
  - Inactive player's button = red (or default).
- Add visual effects when players attack each other.
- Handle game-over state:
  - Stop health below 0.
  - Display winning player and end screen.
- Add a background image to the `<body>`.
- Comment all newly written code to explain its functionality.
